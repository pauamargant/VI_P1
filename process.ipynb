    "This Project aims to apply the knowledge adquired during the first two months of the Information Visualization Course at UPC. With this objective in mind, we have applied different visualizations and data processing techniques in order to analyze the behaviour of traffic accidents in NY City. Our goal has been to create a static visualization which allowed us to answer the following questions:\n",
    "- Are accidents more frequent during weekdays or weekend? Is there any difference between before COVID-19 and after?\n",
    "- Is there any type of vehicle more prone to participate in accidents\n",
    "- At what time of the day are accidents more common?\n",
    "- Are there any areas with a larger number of accidents?\n",
    "- Is there a correlation between weather conditions and accidents?\n",
    "  \n",
    "With there questions in mind, we have performed a diverse set of preprocessing and data transformation techniques to the provided dataset in order to obtain the appropiate visualizations for each of each of the objectives. This notebook aims to guide the reader through the steps that have been followed and the mental process through which the visualizations have been refined and obtained.\n",

    "## Data Preprocessing\n",
    "To begin with, the original dataset has been filtered to encompass the accidents encompassed within the period of *Jun-Sep 2018 and 2019*. This step was performed before downloading the dataset. Afterward, the **Open Refine** software has been used to first approach the data and do the bulk of the preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through Open Refine, we have been able to take a first look at our dataset and determine its columns and which issues need to be solved before proceeding. We identified three main issues:\n",
    "- Many different encodings are used to refer to the same category on some variables, such as vehicle type\n",
    "- Columns containg Null Values\n",
    "- Columns not relevant to our analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "After further analysis, it was found that the presence of null values was not as important as expected, as the columns that, in our opinion, were the most relevant, did not include many null values. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the selection of the relevant columns was not performed on Open-Refine, and no columns were removed. This task was later \n",
    "performed using Pandas in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the main issue with the dataset was the fact that some of the categorical columns were very inconsistent in naming, e.g., the same category was written in many different ways. This was mainly observed in the Vehicle Type column. In other columns, it was not considered relevant, and no action was taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a lot of work was directed toward obtaining a more consistent naming scheme for the Vehicle Type 1 column. This was aimed at normalizing the vehicle type codes. In order to do so, the **clustering** methods of Open Refine were used. With this, we were able to mainly fix orthographic inconsistencies. However, we were still left with many different categories or subcategories, which we believed were too granular for our analysis. Therefore, we manually integrated some of the less frequent categories into more general ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that answering some of the questions required further preprocessing, which will be explained later.\n"

We decided that a focus needed to be made on facilitating comparisons of the trend, more than on showing precise information about the distribution of the accidents.\n",

    "To begin with, we plotted a groupped barplot in which we plotted the number of accidents per day of the week, groupped by before or after covid. We decided that encoding seven distinct values (and therefore bars) was not necessary and could distract the reader. Furthermore, the differences between weekdays were not large. Therefore we decided to plot only for weekday and weekend.\n",

The result is shown in the following visualization.\n",

If we encoded just the number of accidents perpolygon it made smaller polygons appear with a lighter color even if the area had a higher concentration of accidents.

    "### Question 5\n",
    "**Is there a correlation between weather conditions and accidents?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This question proved the most difficult of them all.  To begin with, we had to find a weather dataset. This task was quickly achieved, as many weather datasets are available on the net. However, the first one we used did not provide enough information as many of the columns of the dataset contained many null values. \n",
    "Therefore, we decided on using a second dataset, which contains daily weather data from New York City. The dataset contains many different columns, out of which the following ones were considered to be relevant:\n",
    "- `datetime`\n",
    "- `precip`\n",
    "- `temperature`\n",
    "- `windspeed`\n",
    "- `visibility`\n",
    "- `conditions`\n",
    "  \n",
    "To begin with, we started by visualizing the distribution of the data using `pandas` histogram and describe functions. We observed that, as expected due to being summer data, the weather had moslty relatively high temperatures with relatively few precipitations. This made the visualization design process more challenging, as we had to alse take it into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "We tried two approaches; a lollipop chart that just showed the difference in the mean number of accidents depending on the weather and also a set of heatmaps which showed various weather variables coloured by the amount of accidents normalized by the number of days with the weather combintion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches are displayed in the following cells. The lollipop chart was chosen and is further explained in the results section.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand the heatmaps did not achieve good results as many of the cells had no available data or very few. This made it difficult to understand."

    "The visualizationa allows us to see wether some areas of the city have a higher concentration of accidents than others.
